I found in Information Technology the opportunity to be part of the technological revolution that the world is going through. Being able to be one of the protagonists in this story, in real time. Being able to change lives and paradigms, just as technology changed mine. Therefore, I am always in search of knowledge and wisdom, so that I can apply my skills and principles for the benefit of human well-being and development.


### University Graduate
Systems Analysis and Development

### Studies and Technologies
My focus at the moment is in the area of Web Development, but I am also very interested in Data Science.
In Web Development, I study and apply to my personal projects front-end technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and SASS, and back-end technologies such as Node, Express, Django and Flask. Sometimes I also venture into other languages, such as PHP, C++ and Java.
In the area of Data Science, which I'm focusing less on now, I study Python and related libraries like Pandas and Numpy.
In addition to, I study concepts and techniques such as Unit and Integration Tests, Object Oriented Programming, SOLID and Design Patterns.

### Experience and Projects
At the moment, I'm not working with Programming and I still don't have professional experience in the area, but I'm looking for an opportunity to join the career and have the chance to show my potential. By the way, go to my [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/evertondrosa/) take a look without commitment!
In the meantime, waste no time! I develop some personal projects with the technologies I study (here is the invitation to visit my repository).
My knowledge in the area is in development, but my desire to learn and add is already huge.
