I found in Information Technology the opportunity to be part of the technological revolution that the world is going through. Being able to be one of the protagonists in this story, in real time. Being able to change lives and paradigms, just as technology changed mine. Therefore, I am always in search of knowledge and wisdom, so that I can apply my skills and principles for the benefit of human well-being and development.

### University Graduate
Systems Analysis and Development (01/2020 - 07/2022)

### Studies and Technologies
My focus at the moment is in the area of Web Development, but I am also very interested in Data Science and Automation.
In Web Development, I study and apply to my personal projects front-end technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and SASS, and back-end technologies such as PHP, Laravel, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL.
In the area of Data Science and Automation, which I'm focusing less on now, I study Python and related libraries like Pandas, Numpy and Selenium.

### Experience
At the moment, I still don't have professional experience in a company, but I'm looking for an opportunity to join the career and have the chance to show my potential. By the way, go to my [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/evertondrosa/) take a look without commitment!
In the meantime, waste no time! I develop some personal projects and freelance projects (see below) with the technologies I study (here is the invitation to visit my repository).
